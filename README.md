# Device Checker

## How it works?

1. `Firsts page` is a login page.

2. `Second page` shows all devices.

   - You can fillter devices by `system`, `vendor`, show just `available` or simple search by model in `search` field.
   - If the user is `admin`, then he can go to the third page to `create device`.
   - You can `borrow` device, `return` or check who and when borrowed any device.

3. `Third page` is available just for user type of `admin`.

   - Fill the form with the device details to add new device.

## How to start?

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
  yarn
```

2. Run application

```sh
yarn start
```

Application is running on `http://localhost:3000`
